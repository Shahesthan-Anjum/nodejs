1--What is an EventEmitter in node JS?
The EventEmitter is a module that facilitates communication/interaction between objects in Node.
EventEmitter is at the core of Node asynchronous event-driven architecture.
Many of Node's built-in modules inherit from EventEmitter including prominent frameworks like Express.

2--What is client in node js?
The Node. js Client API enables you to create Node. js applications
that can read, write, and query documents and semantic data in a MarkLogic database.

3--What is a server in node js?
Node. js is an open source server environment. Node. js uses JavaScript on the server.
The task of a web server is to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.

--Client and servers 
Client sends the request to the server and server recieves the request and send the response back to the client.
Protocols-A set of communication rules that boths sides agress to communicate with each other.
What does server side language mean?
Specifically, in Web Application Development there are two types of codes.

--Client- Side
Server-Side

--Client-Side code is the code which executes on the Client PC (The WebSite/WebApp User/Visitor). 
That is the HTML, JavaScript, CSS. This is what Web browsers understand.

--Server-Side code is the code which executes on Server(Where website is hosted). That can be in PHP, C# (IN ASP_NET), PYTHON etc. 
This contains database queries, calculations etc. After executing that code on Server all of that will get 
rendered (Converted) to HTML which we generally see on our web browsers.



--What are the tradeoffs of client-side rendering vs. server-side rendering?
Since Google Plus and a few other cutting-edge websites now render entirely on the client,
let's review why server-side rendering is desirable at all.

--Server-side rendering means when the browser fetches the page over HTTP, 
it immediately gets back HTML describing the page. Server-side rendering is nice because:

--Your content is visible to search engines like Google.
The page loads faster. There's no "white page" while the browser downloads the rendering code
and data and runs the code.
