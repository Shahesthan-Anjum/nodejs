######what is ejs
EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating) is one of the most popular template engines for JavaScript.
As the name suggests, it lets us embed JavaScript code in a template language that is then used to generate HTML.

##########Relation between HTML and EJS:

We actually define HTML in the EJS syntax and specify how and where various data will go on the page.
Then the template engine combines these data and runs programming logic to generate the final HTML page.  
So, the task of EJS is to take your data and inserts it into the web page according to how you’ve defined the template and generate the final HTML. 
For example, you could have a table of dynamic data from a database, and you want EJS to generate the table of data according to your display rules.

########When to use HTML/ EJS?

It varies according to your application. If you want to render a static page 
then go for an HTML file and if you want to render a dynamic page where your data coming from various sources then you must choose an EJS file.
